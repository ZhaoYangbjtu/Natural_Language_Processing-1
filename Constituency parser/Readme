Constituency parser: This project aims to build a build a parser that learned probability context-free grammar rules from train document.
Implemented Viterbi algorithm and apply the rules that we learned to parse sentences.
The result is: precision	0.920091324201
               recall	    0.855626326964
               F1	        0.886688668867
