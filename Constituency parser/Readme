This project aims to build a build a parser that learned probability context-free grammer rules from train document.
Implemented viterbi algorithm and apply the rules that we learnt to parse sentences. 
The result is: precision	0.920091324201
               recall	    0.855626326964
               F1	        0.886688668867
