Built a feature set including IS_ALNUM, IS_DIGIT, IS_LOWER, IS_UPPER, CONTAINING_NUM, CONTAINING_SPECIAL, FIRST_UPPER, START_WITH_TWITTERTAG(@), HASH, and there is a corpus of Lexicons of diffirent types, so for example if "Peter" is in person then give him a tag of PERSON, and then using logistic regression and CRF to do name entity recognition.
